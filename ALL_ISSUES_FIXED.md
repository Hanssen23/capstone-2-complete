## **How to Use Your Website:**

### **3. Create an Admin User**
To login, you need to create an admin user first:

cd /var/www/silencio-gym
php artisan tinker

# In tinker:
$user = new App\Models\User();
$user->name = 'Admin';
$user->email = 'admin@silencio.gym';
$user->password = bcrypt('your-password');
$user->save();
exit
```

### **4. Login and Use the System**
- Login with the credentials you created
- Access dashboard, members, payments, etc.
- All pages now have full CSS styling
- All images and icons display correctly

---

## **Technical Details:**

### **Authentication Flow:**
```
1. User visits protected page (e.g., /membership/payments)
2. Middleware checks if authenticated
3. If not authenticated, redirects to /login
4. User logs in
5. Redirected back to original page
```

### **CSS Loading:**
```
1. Layout loads Vite manifest
2. Manifest points to compiled CSS
3. Browser loads app-CtvocsAC.css (Tailwind)
4. Additional CSS files loaded (dropdown, sidebar)
5. Full styling applied
```

### **File Permissions:**
```
Owner: www-data:www-data (web server user)
Directories: 755 (rwxr-xr-x)
Files: 644 (rw-r--r--)
Storage: 775 (rwxrwxr-x)
