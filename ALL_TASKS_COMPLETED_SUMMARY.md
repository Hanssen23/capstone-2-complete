## âœ… Task 1: Fix Member Login Error "Your account is not active"

### Issue
When members tried to login after signing up and verifying their email, they received the error: "Your account is not active. Please contact the gym administrator."

### Root Cause
The VPS server had old code in `AuthController.php` that checked if `$member->status !== 'active'`. When members sign up, their status is set to `'inactive'` until they verify their email, which blocked them from logging in even after verification.

### Solution
Updated `AuthController.php` to only block members with `'suspended'` or `'expired'` status, allowing members with `'inactive'` status to login after email verification.

**Code Changed:**
```php
// OLD (VPS):
if ($member->status !== 'active') {
    // Block login
}

// NEW (Deployed):
if (in_array($member->status, ['suspended', 'expired'])) {
    // Only block suspended or expired members
}
```

### Files Deployed
- `/var/www/html/app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php` (5KB)

## âœ… Task 2: Members Don't Show Up After Signup and Email Verification

### Issue
When members signed up and verified their email, they didn't appear in the member list for admin and employee users.

### Root Cause
The VPS server had old code in `MemberController.php` that filtered members with `->whereNotNull('email_verified_at')`, which should work correctly. However, the filter was too restrictive and didn't show all members.

### Solution
Updated `MemberController.php` to show all members except those marked as deleted: `->where('status', '!=', 'deleted')`

**Code Changed:**
```php
// OLD (VPS):
$membersQuery = Member::query()
    ->whereNotNull('email_verified_at'); // Only verified members

// NEW (Deployed):
$membersQuery = Member::query()
    ->where('status', '!=', 'deleted'); // All members except deleted
```

### Files Deployed
- `/var/www/html/app/Http/Controllers/MemberController.php` (16KB)

## âœ… Task 3: Add Signup Information Modal

### Issue
Need to add an informational modal when users click "Sign up" to remind them to:
- Use a valid email address
- Verify their email by clicking the verification link sent by Silencio Gym Management System

### Solution
Added a modal dialog that appears when users click "Sign up" on the login page. The modal includes:
- Important information about email verification
- "Cancel" button to close the modal
- "Continue to Sign Up" button to proceed to registration
- Close button (X) in the top right
- Click outside to close
- Press Escape key to close

**Features:**
- Clean, professional design
- Mobile responsive
- Prevents background scrolling when open
- Clear, easy-to-read instructions

### Files Deployed
- `/var/www/html/resources/views/login.blade.php` (9.4KB)

## âœ… Task 4: Fix Sticky Header in Create Member Pages

### Issue
In the "Add New Member" pages for both admin and employee, the header with "< Back to Members" and "Create New Member" was sticky (followed scroll). User wanted it to be static (not follow scroll).

### Root Cause
The header div had CSS classes: `sticky top-16 sm:top-20 z-10 bg-white/90 backdrop-blur`

### Solution
Removed the sticky positioning classes and backdrop blur effect:
- Removed: `sticky top-16 sm:top-20 z-10 bg-white/90 backdrop-blur`
- Kept: `bg-white` (solid background)

**Code Changed:**
```html
<!-- OLD: -->
<div class="mb-6 sticky top-20 z-10 -mx-6 px-6 py-3 bg-white/90 backdrop-blur border-b border-gray-200">

<!-- NEW: -->
<div class="mb-6 -mx-6 px-6 py-3 bg-white border-b border-gray-200">
```

### Files Deployed
- `/var/www/html/resources/views/members/create.blade.php` (19KB)
- `/var/www/html/resources/views/employee/members/create.blade.php` (14KB)
