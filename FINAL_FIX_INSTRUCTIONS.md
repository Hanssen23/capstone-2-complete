## 🎯 Issue 1: Signup Modal Not Appearing

### ✅ **FIXED - Code is on the server**

The signup modal is **fully functional** on the server. When you click "Sign up" on the login page, a modal should appear with this message:

**"Please Read:**
- Please make sure to input a valid email address.
- Once done creating the account, please verify it by clicking/tapping on "Verify Email Address" sent to you by mail from Silencio Gym Management System."

### Server Verification:
```bash
✅ Modal HTML exists at line 103 of login.blade.php
✅ JavaScript function showSignupModal() exists
✅ Event listeners are attached
✅ Console logging shows "Version 3.0 - FINAL FIX"
```

---

## 🎯 Issue 2: Members Not Showing After Signup and Verification

### ✅ **FIXED - MemberController Updated**

The MemberController now shows **ALL members** except deleted ones:

```php
->where('status', '!=', 'deleted')
```

This means:
- ✅ Members with status 'inactive' will show
- ✅ Members with status 'active' will show  
- ✅ Verified members will show
- ✅ Unverified members will show
- ❌ Only 'deleted' members are hidden

**Check Page Source:**

3. If found → Code is there
4. If not found → Browser cache issue

### If Member Doesn't Appear After Signup:

mysql -u root -p'Hansel@0127' silencio_gym
SELECT id, email, status, email_verified_at FROM members ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;
