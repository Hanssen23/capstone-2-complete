## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

2. ✅ Removed pointer-events blocking
3. ✅ Added dark backgrounds to modals
4. ✅ Force close receipt modal before showing warning
5. ✅ Added proper button types and cursor styles

## 🐛 **If Buttons Still Don't Work**

**Open Browser Console (F12) and run:**

```javascript
// Check z-index
const modal = document.getElementById('adminWarningModal');
console.log('Z-Index:', window.getComputedStyle(modal).zIndex);

// Test button click
document.getElementById('adminWarningContinue').click();
```

**Expected:**
- Z-Index should be: `10001`
- Button click should work

Receipt Modal:        z-9999  (Closes first)
