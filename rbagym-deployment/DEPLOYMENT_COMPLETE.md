## Monitoring

### Check Logs

If you encounter any issues, check the Laravel logs:

```bash
ssh root@156.67.221.184
tail -f /var/www/silencio-gym/storage/logs/laravel.log
```

Look for entries containing:
- "Member registered successfully" - Successful registrations
- "Payment created" - Successful payments
- "Registration error" - Registration failures
- "Payment processing failed" - Payment failures
- "Logout error" - Logout issues

### Check UID Pool Status

To check if UID pool has enough available UIDs:

```bash
ssh root@156.67.221.184
cd /var/www/silencio-gym
php artisan tinker
>>> DB::table('uid_pool')->where('status', 'available')->count();
>>> exit
```

If the count is low (< 5), run the seeder again:

```bash
php seed_uid_pool.php
```
