## ⏱️ Time & Risk

- **Time to deploy:** ~5 minutes
- **Risk level:** 🟢 LOW (can rollback easily)
- **Difficulty:** 🟢 EASY

---

## 🔧 What Changed

### The Problem
Shared routes (member plans, accounts, payments, members) were inside the `admin.only` middleware group. When employees tried to access these routes, the middleware would reject them and call `logout()`.

### The Solution
Restructured `routes/web.php` into three separate groups:
1. **Shared routes** - Protected only by `auth` middleware (both admin and employee)
2. **Admin-only routes** - Protected by `auth` + `admin.only` middleware
3. **Employee-only routes** - Protected by `auth` + `employee.only` middleware

### Result
✅ Both admin and employee can access shared routes
✅ No forced logout when navigating
✅ Proper role-based access control maintained
✅ Session stays active

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Still getting forced logout?
1. Verify file was uploaded:
   ```bash
   head -20 /var/www/silencio-gym/routes/web.php
   ```
   Should show: `// Shared Routes for Admin and Employee`

2. Clear caches again:
   ```bash
   php artisan cache:clear && php artisan route:clear
   ```

3. Check logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/www/silencio-gym/storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```

### Need to rollback?
```bash
cd /var/www/silencio-gym
cp routes/web.php.backup routes/web.php
php artisan route:clear && php artisan config:clear && php artisan cache:clear
```
