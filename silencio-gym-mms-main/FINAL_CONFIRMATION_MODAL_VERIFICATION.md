3. Clicks "Confirm Payment" in receipt preview
4. Admin Warning Modal appears
5. Clicks "Yes, Override" button

   ‚úÖ Member's membership dates are updated
   ‚úÖ Success message is displayed
   ‚úÖ Form is reset for next transaction
   ‚úÖ Payment appears in "All Payments" list
```

#### **Backend Processing (MembershipController.php):**

**Step 1: Validate Request**
- Checks `admin_override=true` flag
- Skips active membership check (because admin override)
- Validates all required fields

**Step 2: Log Admin Action**
- Logs admin ID, email, member ID, plan type, duration, reason
- Logs timestamp and IP address

**Step 3: Database Transaction**
- Deactivates existing active memberships:
  ```sql
  UPDATE membership_periods 
  SET status='overridden', notes='...' 
  WHERE member_id=X AND status='active' AND start_date<=NOW() AND expiration_date>NOW()
  ```

- Creates payment record:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO payments (member_id, amount, plan_type, duration_type, 
                        membership_start_date, membership_expiration_date, 
                        status, is_pwd, is_senior_citizen, discount_amount, ...)
  VALUES (...)
  ```

- Creates new membership period:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO membership_periods (member_id, payment_id, plan_type, 
                                  duration_type, start_date, expiration_date, 
                                  status, notes)
  VALUES (...)
  ```

**Step 4: Return Success Response**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Payment processed successfully",
  "payment_id": 123,
  "membership_period_id": 456
}
```

### **SCENARIO 2: CANCEL PAYMENT (At Any Time)**

#### **Expected Flow:**
```
1. User selects member with active plan
2. Fills payment details
3. Clicks "Confirm Payment" in receipt preview
4. Admin Warning Modal appears
5. Clicks "Yes, Override" button
6. Final Confirmation Modal appears
7. Clicks "Cancel" button (can be clicked immediately)
   ‚Üì
   EXPECTED RESULTS:
   ‚úÖ Modal closes immediately
   ‚úÖ No payment is processed
   ‚úÖ No database changes are made
   ‚úÖ Existing membership remains active (unchanged)
   ‚úÖ No payment record is created
   ‚úÖ User returns to payment form
   ‚úÖ Form data is preserved (can edit and retry)
```

#### **Frontend Processing (manage-member.blade.php):**

**handleAdminFinalCancel() Function:**
```javascript
function handleAdminFinalCancel(event) {
    console.log('Admin final cancel button clicked - Cancelling payment');
    
    if (event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        event.stopPropagation();
    }
    
    // Hide all modals
    PaymentValidation.hideAllModals();
    
    // Show cancellation message
    console.log('Payment override cancelled by user');
    
    return false;
}
```

**Result:**
- Modals are hidden
- No API call is made
- No database changes occur
