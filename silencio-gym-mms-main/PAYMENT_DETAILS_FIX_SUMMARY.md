# 🎉 Payment Details Active/Inactive Status Removal - COMPLETED

## ✅ **Issue Fixed**

### **Problem**: 
Payment details displayed confusing "Active/Inactive" status for membership periods that provided no useful information and could confuse users.

### **Solution**: 
Completely removed the Active/Inactive status display from payment details while keeping all other relevant information.

## 🔧 **What Was Changed**

### **File Modified:**
- `resources/views/membership/payments/details.blade.php`

### **Specific Change:**
Removed lines 78-86 that displayed:
```php
<div class="flex justify-between">
    <span class="text-sm font-medium text-gray-500">Status:</span>
    <span class="px-2 py-1 text-xs font-semibold rounded-full
        @if($payment->member->currentMembershipPeriod->is_active) bg-green-100 text-green-800
        @else bg-red-100 text-red-800
        @endif">
        {{ $payment->member->currentMembershipPeriod->is_active ? 'Active' : 'Inactive' }}
    </span>
</div>
```
