## Testing After Deployment

### Admin User
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to `/membership/plans` ‚Üí Should work ‚úÖ
3. Navigate to `/accounts` ‚Üí Should work ‚úÖ
4. Navigate to `/members` ‚Üí Should work ‚úÖ

### Employee User
1. Login as employee
2. Navigate to `/membership/plans` ‚Üí Should work ‚úÖ
3. Navigate to `/accounts` ‚Üí Should work ‚úÖ
4. Navigate to `/members` ‚Üí Should work ‚úÖ

### Session
1. Refresh page ‚Üí Should stay logged in ‚úÖ
2. Navigate between pages ‚Üí Should stay logged in ‚úÖ
3. No "Session Expired" modal should appear ‚úÖ

## What Changed

### The Problem
Shared routes (member plans, accounts, payments) were inside the `admin.only` middleware group. When employees tried to access these routes, the middleware would reject them and call `logout()`.

### The Solution
Restructured `routes/web.php` to separate:
1. **Shared routes** - Protected only by `auth` middleware (both admin and employee)
2. **Admin-only routes** - Protected by `auth` + `admin.only` middleware
3. **Employee-only routes** - Protected by `auth` + `employee.only` middleware

### Result
‚úÖ Both admin and employee can access shared routes
‚úÖ No forced logout when navigating
‚úÖ Proper role-based access control maintained
‚úÖ Session stays active

## Files Modified
- `routes/web.php` - Restructured route groups

## Deployment Time
‚è±Ô∏è **~5 minutes** (including testing)

## Risk Level
üü¢ **LOW** - Can be rolled back easily if needed

## Support

### If deployment fails:
1. Check `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for troubleshooting
2. Check Laravel logs: `tail -f /var/www/silencio-gym/storage/logs/laravel.log`
3. Verify file upload: `head -20 /var/www/silencio-gym/routes/web.php`

### If you need to rollback:
```bash
cd /var/www/silencio-gym
cp routes/web.php.backup routes/web.php
php artisan route:clear && php artisan config:clear && php artisan cache:clear
```

## Next Steps

1. **Extract the ZIP file**
   - `vps_forced_logout_fix_deploy.zip`

2. **Choose deployment method**
   - Hostinger File Manager (easiest)
   - SSH (if you have access)
   - Git (if set up)

3. **Follow the deployment guide**
   - See `HOSTINGER_FILE_MANAGER_DEPLOYMENT.md` for File Manager
   - See `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for SSH/Git

4. **Test the fix**
   - Login as admin and employee
   - Navigate between pages
   - Verify no forced logout

5. **Verify in production**
   - Visit http://156.67.221.184/login
   - Test all scenarios
