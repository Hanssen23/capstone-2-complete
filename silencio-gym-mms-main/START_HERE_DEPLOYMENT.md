## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Admin can navigate to `/membership/plans` without logout
- [ ] Employee can navigate to `/membership/plans` without logout
- [ ] Employee can navigate to `/accounts` without logout
- [ ] Employee can navigate to `/members` without logout
- [ ] Admin can access `/rfid-monitor` (admin-only)
- [ ] Employee cannot access `/rfid-monitor` (redirected)
- [ ] No "Session Expired" modal appears
- [ ] Users stay logged in while navigating

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Still getting forced logout?
1. Verify file was uploaded:
   ```bash
   head -20 /var/www/silencio-gym/routes/web.php
   ```
   Should show: `// Shared Routes for Admin and Employee`

2. Clear caches again:
   ```bash
   php artisan cache:clear && php artisan route:clear
   ```

3. Check logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/www/silencio-gym/storage/logs/laravel.log
   ```

### Upload failed?
1. Check file permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod 755 /var/www/silencio-gym/routes/
   ```

2. Try uploading again

### Need to rollback?
```bash
cd /var/www/silencio-gym
cp routes/web.php.backup routes/web.php
php artisan route:clear && php artisan config:clear && php artisan cache:clear
```

## 📋 What Changed

### Before (Broken)
```
Route::middleware(['auth', 'admin.only'])->group(function () {
    // /membership/plans (admin only)
    // /accounts (admin only)
    // /members (admin only)
    
    // Employee routes nested inside
    Route::prefix('employee')->middleware('employee.only')->group(...)
});
```

**Problem:** When employee accesses `/membership/plans`, it's inside `admin.only` middleware, so they get logged out.

### After (Fixed)
```
// Shared routes (both can access)
Route::middleware(['auth'])->group(function () {
    // /membership/plans (shared)
    // /accounts (shared)
    // /members (shared)
});

// Admin-only routes
Route::middleware(['auth', 'admin.only'])->group(function () {
    // /rfid-monitor (admin only)
});

// Employee-only routes
Route::middleware(['auth', 'employee.only'])->group(function () {
    // /employee/dashboard (employee only)
});
```

**Solution:** Shared routes are now in a separate group with only `auth` middleware.
