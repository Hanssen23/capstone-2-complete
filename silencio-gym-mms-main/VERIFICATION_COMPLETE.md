2. ✅ Payment processes with `admin_override=true` flag
3. ✅ Backend deactivates existing membership (sets status='overridden')
4. ✅ Backend creates new payment record with all details
5. ✅ Backend creates new membership period with new dates
6. ✅ Member's plan is changed to the new selected plan
7. ✅ Member's membership dates are updated to reflect new plan
8. ✅ Payment record is created in database with admin_override flag
9. ✅ Payment appears in "All Payments" list
10. ✅ Success message is displayed
11. ✅ Form is reset for next transaction

**Implementation Details:**

- **Button State:** DISABLED during countdown, ENABLED after countdown
- **Countdown:** 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0 (5 seconds total)
