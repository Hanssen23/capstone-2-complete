echo "1. ‚úÖ Fixed Redirect Destination:\n";
echo "   - Admin/Member logout: Redirects to /login\n";
echo "   - Employee logout: Redirects to /employee/login\n";
echo "   - No more redirect to dashboard\n\n";

echo "2. ‚úÖ User Type Detection:\n";
echo "   - Detects if user is employee before logout\n";
echo "   - Routes to appropriate login page\n";
echo "   - Handles both web and member guards\n\n";

echo "3. ‚úÖ Proper Session Management:\n";
echo "   - Logs out from both guards (web and member)\n";
echo "   - Invalidates session completely\n";
echo "   - Regenerates CSRF token\n\n";

echo "4. ‚úÖ Error Handling:\n";
echo "   - Graceful error handling with try-catch\n";
echo "   - Force logout on errors\n";
echo "   - Always redirects to login on error\n\n";

echo "5. ‚úÖ Success Messages:\n";
echo "   - Shows success message after logout\n";
echo "   - Shows error message if session expired\n";
echo "   - User feedback for all scenarios\n\n";
