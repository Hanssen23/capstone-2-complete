echo "\n=== SWIPE BEHAVIOR IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED ===\n\n";

echo "1. ✅ Reduced Sensitivity:\n";
echo "   - Swipe threshold increased from 50px to 100px\n";
echo "   - Minimum swipe distance: 30px\n";
echo "   - Maximum swipe time: 500ms\n\n";

echo "2. ✅ Edge Detection:\n";
echo "   - Swipes only start from left 30px of screen\n";
echo "   - Or when sidebar is already open\n";
echo "   - Prevents accidental swipes from content area\n\n";

echo "3. ✅ Vertical Movement Handling:\n";
echo "   - Maximum vertical deviation: 50px\n";
echo "   - Cancels swipe if too much vertical movement\n";
echo "   - Prevents interference with scrolling\n\n";

echo "4. ✅ Velocity Detection:\n";
echo "   - Fast swipes (>0.3 px/ms) trigger with less distance\n";
echo "   - Allows quick flick gestures\n";
echo "   - More natural swipe behavior\n\n";

echo "5. ✅ Enhanced Validation:\n";
echo "   - Multiple criteria must be met for valid swipe\n";
echo "   - Distance OR velocity threshold\n";
echo "   - Within time and vertical limits\n";
echo "   - Proper horizontal direction\n\n";

echo "6. ✅ Improved Touch Handling:\n";
echo "   - Better touch start detection\n";
echo "   - Smoother touch move tracking\n";
echo "   - More reliable touch end processing\n\n";

echo "7. ✅ Mobile-Only Activation:\n";
echo "   - Touch listeners only added on mobile (≤1024px)\n";
echo "   - No interference on desktop\n";
echo "   - Better performance\n\n";

echo "=== SWIPE PARAMETERS ===\n\n";

echo "📏 **Distance Thresholds:**\n";
echo "   - Swipe Threshold: 100px (main trigger)\n";
echo "   - Minimum Distance: 30px (start recognition)\n";
echo "   - Maximum Vertical: 50px (cancel if exceeded)\n\n";

echo "⏱️ **Time Constraints:**\n";
echo "   - Maximum Swipe Time: 500ms\n";
echo "   - Velocity Threshold: 0.3 px/ms\n\n";

echo "📍 **Spatial Constraints:**\n";
echo "   - Left Edge Zone: 30px from left edge\n";
echo "   - Horizontal Priority: Must be more horizontal than vertical\n\n";

echo "=== BEHAVIOR CHANGES ===\n\n";

echo "**Before (Too Sensitive):**\n";
echo "❌ 50px threshold - too easy to trigger\n";
echo "❌ No edge detection - swipes from anywhere\n";
echo "❌ No vertical movement handling\n";
echo "❌ No velocity consideration\n";
echo "❌ Simple distance-only detection\n\n";

echo "**After (Improved):**\n";
echo "✅ 100px threshold - requires intentional swipe\n";
echo "✅ Left edge detection - only from intended area\n";
echo "✅ Vertical movement cancellation - no scroll interference\n";
echo "✅ Velocity-based detection - natural quick swipes\n";
echo "✅ Multi-criteria validation - more reliable\n\n";

echo "=== TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS ===\n\n";

echo "1. 📱 **Test Swipe Scenarios:**\n";
echo "   - Light touch from left edge (should work)\n";
echo "   - Strong swipe from left edge (should work)\n";
echo "   - Quick flick from left edge (should work)\n";
echo "   - Swipe from middle of screen (should NOT work)\n";
echo "   - Vertical scroll gesture (should NOT interfere)\n";
echo "   - Diagonal swipe (should be filtered out)\n\n";

echo "2. 🎯 **Test Edge Cases:**\n";
echo "   - Very slow swipe (should require full distance)\n";
echo "   - Very fast swipe (should work with less distance)\n";
echo "   - Swipe with vertical component (should cancel if too much)\n";
echo "   - Multiple finger touches (should be ignored)\n\n";

echo "3. 📐 **Test Different Distances:**\n";
echo "   - 20px swipe (should NOT trigger)\n";
echo "   - 50px swipe (should NOT trigger unless fast)\n";
echo "   - 100px swipe (should trigger)\n";
echo "   - 150px swipe (should definitely trigger)\n\n";

echo "4. ⏰ **Test Timing:**\n";
echo "   - Very slow swipe (>500ms) should not trigger\n";
echo "   - Normal swipe (<500ms) should work\n";
echo "   - Quick swipe (<200ms) should work with velocity\n\n";

echo "=== EXPECTED USER EXPERIENCE ===\n\n";

echo "✅ **More Intentional:** Users need to deliberately swipe from edge\n";
echo "✅ **Less Accidental:** No more accidental sidebar opens\n";
echo "✅ **Natural Feel:** Quick flicks work, slow drags need distance\n";
echo "✅ **Scroll Friendly:** Vertical scrolling won't trigger sidebar\n";
echo "✅ **Responsive:** Still feels responsive for intentional gestures\n\n";

echo "Swipe behavior is now much less sensitive and more user-friendly! 🎉\n";
echo "Users will have better control and fewer accidental activations.\n";
