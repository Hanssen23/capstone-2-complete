# Route Structure Diagram - Fixed Forced Logout Issue

## Problem Visualization

### BEFORE (Causing Forced Logout)
```
Route::middleware(['auth', 'admin.only'])->group(function () {
    ├── /members/* (admin only)
    ├── /membership/plans (admin only)
    ├── /accounts/* (admin only)
    ├── /membership/payments/* (admin only)
    │
    └── Route::prefix('employee')->middleware('employee.only')->group(function () {
        ├── /employee/dashboard
        ├── /employee/members/*
        └── /employee/membership/plans
});

PROBLEM: When employee navigates to /membership/plans
→ Route is inside admin.only middleware
→ AdminOnly middleware checks: Is user admin? NO
→ AdminOnly middleware logs them out (line 52)
→ FORCED LOGOUT! ❌
```

### AFTER (Fixed - No Forced Logout)
```
Route::middleware(['auth'])->group(function () {
    ├── /members/* (shared - both can access)
    ├── /membership/plans (shared - both can access)
    ├── /accounts/* (shared - both can access)
    └── /membership/payments/* (shared - both can access)
});

Route::middleware(['auth', 'admin.only'])->group(function () {
    ├── /rfid-monitor (admin only)
    ├── /rfid/* (admin only)
    └── /auto-deletion/* (admin only)
});

Route::middleware(['auth', 'employee.only'])->group(function () {
    ├── /employee/dashboard (employee only)
    ├── /employee/members/* (employee only)
    └── /employee/membership/* (employee only)
});

RESULT: When employee navigates to /membership/plans
→ Route is in shared middleware group
→ Only auth middleware checks: Is user authenticated? YES
→ Route is accessible
→ NO FORCED LOGOUT! ✅
```

## Access Control Matrix

| Route | Admin | Employee | Member | Unauthenticated |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|
| `/membership/plans` | ✅ Access | ✅ Access | ❌ Redirect | ❌ Redirect to login |
| `/accounts/*` | ✅ Access | ✅ Access | ❌ Redirect | ❌ Redirect to login |
| `/members/*` | ✅ Access | ✅ Access | ❌ Redirect | ❌ Redirect to login |
| `/rfid-monitor` | ✅ Access | ❌ Redirect | ❌ Redirect | ❌ Redirect to login |
| `/employee/dashboard` | ❌ Redirect | ✅ Access | ❌ Redirect | ❌ Redirect to login |
| `/auto-deletion/*` | ✅ Access | ❌ Redirect | ❌ Redirect | ❌ Redirect to login |

## Middleware Chain Explanation

### Shared Routes (auth only)
```
Request → auth middleware → Check if authenticated
                          ├─ YES → Allow access ✅
                          └─ NO → Redirect to login ❌
```

### Admin-Only Routes (auth + admin.only)
```
Request → auth middleware → Check if authenticated
                          ├─ NO → Redirect to login ❌
                          └─ YES → admin.only middleware
                                  ├─ Is admin? YES → Allow access ✅
                                  ├─ Is employee? → Redirect to employee dashboard ✅
                                  └─ Other? → Logout and redirect to login ❌
```

### Employee-Only Routes (auth + employee.only)
```
Request → auth middleware → Check if authenticated
                          ├─ NO → Redirect to login ❌
                          └─ YES → employee.only middleware
                                  ├─ Is employee? YES → Allow access ✅
                                  ├─ Is admin? → Redirect to admin dashboard ✅
                                  └─ Other? → Redirect to login ❌
```

## Key Differences

### Old Behavior (Forced Logout)
- Employee tries to access `/membership/plans`
- Route is inside `admin.only` middleware
- `AdminOnly::handle()` line 52: `Auth::guard('web')->logout()`
- **User is logged out** ❌

### New Behavior (Proper Redirect)
- Employee tries to access `/membership/plans`
- Route is in shared `auth` middleware
- Only checks if authenticated (YES)
- **User can access the route** ✅

- Employee tries to access `/rfid-monitor`
- Route is inside `admin.only` middleware
- `AdminOnly::handle()` line 46: `redirect()->route('employee.dashboard')`
- **User is redirected, not logged out** ✅

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Admin Login → Navigate to Member Plans
```
1. Admin logs in successfully
2. Admin navigates to /membership/plans
3. Route is in shared auth middleware
4. Admin passes auth check
5. Admin can view member plans ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Employee Login → Navigate to Member Plans
```
1. Employee logs in successfully
2. Employee navigates to /membership/plans
3. Route is in shared auth middleware
4. Employee passes auth check
5. Employee can view member plans ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Employee Login → Navigate to RFID Monitor
```
1. Employee logs in successfully
2. Employee navigates to /rfid-monitor
3. Route is in admin.only middleware
4. Employee fails admin.only check
5. Employee is redirected to /employee/dashboard ✅
6. Employee is NOT logged out ✅
```

### Scenario 4: Admin Login → Navigate to Employee Dashboard
```
1. Admin logs in successfully
2. Admin navigates to /employee/dashboard
3. Route is in employee.only middleware
4. Admin fails employee.only check
5. Admin is redirected to /dashboard ✅
6. Admin is NOT logged out ✅
