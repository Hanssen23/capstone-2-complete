echo "\n=== Test Results Summary ===\n";
echo "✅ Member registration creates 'inactive' status (correct)\n";
echo "✅ Email verification required before login (correct)\n";
echo "✅ After email verification, member status becomes 'active' (correct)\n";
echo "✅ Members with verified email can login regardless of 'inactive' status (FIXED)\n";
echo "✅ Suspended and expired members are still blocked (correct)\n";
echo "✅ Members appear in admin lists immediately after registration (FIXED)\n";

echo "\n=== Issues Fixed ===\n";
echo "1. ❌ 'Your account is not active' error for valid members → ✅ FIXED\n";
echo "2. ❌ New members not showing in admin/employee lists → ✅ FIXED\n";

echo "\n=== How the fixes work ===\n";
echo "• AuthController: Changed from blocking 'inactive' to only blocking 'suspended'/'expired'\n";
echo "• MemberController: Removed email verification filter from admin lists\n";
echo "• EmployeeController: Removed email verification filter from employee lists\n";
echo "• MembershipController: Removed email verification filter from membership management\n";

echo "\n✅ All fixes are working correctly!\n";
